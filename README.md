🌱 Multipurpose Agriculture Robot
📌 Project Overview

The Multipurpose Agriculture Robot is a smart farming solution designed to help farmers and agriculture students by automating basic farming tasks.
This robot can monitor soil moisture, water crops automatically, drop seeds, and spray pesticides, reducing human effort and increasing efficiency.

The project focuses on low-cost automation, making it suitable for small-scale farming and educational purposes.

# 🎯 Aim of the Project

To design and develop an automated agriculture robot that can:

Save water

Reduce manual labor

Improve crop care using simple sensors and actuators

# ⚙️ Key Features

🌾 Soil Moisture Monitoring
Continuously checks soil moisture level using a soil moisture sensor.

🚰 Automatic Irrigation System
Water pump turns ON automatically when soil is dry and turns OFF when sufficient moisture is detected.

🌱 Seed Dropping Mechanism
Seeds are dropped at fixed intervals to ensure proper spacing.

🧪 Pesticide Spraying System
Sprays pesticides uniformly to protect crops from insects and diseases.

🚜 Movement System
Robot moves forward/backward using DC motors for field navigation.

🔔 Buzzer Alert
Gives an alert when soil is too dry and watering is required.

🧠 Working Principle

The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture level of the soil.

If the soil is dry, the Arduino activates the water pump automatically.

The robot moves through the field and performs seed dropping and pesticide spraying.

Once the soil reaches the required moisture level, the pump is turned OFF.

A buzzer alerts the user during dry soil conditions.
